## ⚠️ Development Zone

This directory contains experimental scripts, prototypes, and work-in-progress code. Enter at your own risk - these digital experiments may contain bugs, incomplete features, or untested algorithms.

### 🧪 Current Projects
- **Alpha Builds**: Early-stage script development
- **Proof of Concepts**: Testing new hacking methodologies
- **Experimental Features**: Bleeding-edge functionality testing
- **Debug Versions**: Scripts under active development and debugging
- **Research Projects**: Long-term development initiatives

### ⚡ Development Guidelines
- ⚠️ **DO NOT** deploy WIP scripts to production servers
- 🔄 Test extensively in isolated environments
- 📝 Document known issues and limitations
- 🎯 Move stable code to appropriate production directories
- 💾 Maintain regular backups of experimental work

### 🛡️ Risk Assessment
**HIGH RISK**: These scripts may:
- Consume excessive resources
- Contain security vulnerabilities  
- Produce unexpected results
- Crash or hang systems

### 📊 Status Indicators
- 🔴 **Broken**: Known to have critical issues
- 🟡 **Unstable**: Functional but unreliable
- 🟢 **Testing**: Ready for controlled testing
- 🔵 **Review**: Pending code review before promotion
